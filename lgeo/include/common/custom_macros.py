LGEO Disclaimer
Well, it is possible but not recommended. LGEO uses a different coordinate
system and scaling than LDRAW, so it may be pretty hard to build a model by
placing the parts by hand. In LGEO, for historic reasons Y axis is the depth
axis, and Z is the up axis, where also Z has switched sign to LDRAW Y axis.
Sorry for that, but my understanding of coordinate to this time was a flat
standard XY coordinate system with a third Z axis coming out of the plane.
Scaling is to real measurements, where 1 POV-Ray unit is 10mm. So 0.8 is 20
LDU (width of a LEGO brick) and 0.96 is 24 LDU (height of a LEGO brick).
